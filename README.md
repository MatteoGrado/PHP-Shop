PHP-Shop |--->Matteo Grado<---|

I use OOP for Code this project.
You can find every day in the week at 17ðŸ•™ a new version or patch for the project.
The connection to the DB works with PDO and a DB class.
When I have complete the database than you will find a .sql file in the doc folder.
I also place the .sql file in the /Models/ directory.
To bring up this Shop to work you have to install some type of local Server.
You have also to bring up composer for autoloading the classes because
I use them in many files.
Fetures hwo can use at the moment:
- Login
- Register
- Different pages (Router planed)
- Filling in contact form (soon coming)

Planed Fetures:
- Router for redirecting
- Functional Dashboard
- Redirects in the dashboard
- Contact form hwo works
- Paymant

Other Stuff coming up soon!
